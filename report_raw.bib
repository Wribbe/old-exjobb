@article{c_personas_article_controlled_experiment,
Abstract = {Understanding the users' needs is important for designing an application that provides a good usage experience. One can use design thinking (DT) to help identify those needs. Persona is a technique used in DT to support the requirements elicitation by describing user profiles. Nevertheless, the persona descriptions created using a traditional template may include many details about the users that are not relevant to the application design. To overcome this limitation, the authors proposed the PATHY technique to guide software engineers in creating and describing more useful personas, i.e. personas with information that is more relevant to the application design. They conducted an experiment to compare PATHY to another persona-based technique which uses a traditional template and also supports the representation of the application's requirements. In this study, they assessed which of the two techniques helps to generate descriptions of personas that are more focused on potential requir},

@article{c_personas_article_and_usercentered_design,
Abstract = {User-Centred Design (UCD) was proposed in the 1980s and, since then, its philosophy has helped to solve design problems, regardless of the advances in technology over time. The standard ISO 9241:210 (2010), formerly ISO 13407, provides guidance in human-centred design principles and activities undertaken throughout the design lifecycle to further support UCD. In addition, since it was mentioned in ISO 9241:210, UCD has also utilised User Experience Design (UXD) in recent years. There are many approaches that support UCD to ensure it is more attainable when designing. In addition, large firms, such as HP, IBM and Microsoft, use anthropologists in their user research in order to make products more user-centred. However, the concept of UCD should, theoretically, be more widely used in all product design and it is intriguing as to why it is not as popular as it should be. As noticed in the real world, imperfect designs still frustrate us everywhere. The aims of this thesis were to investi},

Abstract = {This paper investigates personas, an alternative method for representing and communicating customer needs. By using a narrative, picture, and name, a persona provides product designers with a vivid representation of the design target. Numerous benefits of incorporating personas into product design approaches have been suggested, but the present literature fails to identify the most significant and universal advantages of persona use. By incorporating expert opinion through the use of Delphi methodology, this research first examines the benefits of incorporating personas into design processes. After gaining consensus on the perceived importance of the individual benefits, this paper then elaborates on the most significant benefits of persona use and needed future research on the personas method.},

@article{c_persona_article_empiraical_influence_with_personality?,
Abstract = {Persona, an archetypical user, is increasingly becoming a popular tool for Software Engineers to design and communicate with stakeholders. A persona is a representative of a class of end users of a product or service. However, the majority of personas presented in the literature do not take into consideration that the personality of users affects the way they interact with a product or service. This study empirically explores variations in conceptual design based on the personality of a persona. We carried out two studies in Australia and one study in Denmark. We presented four personas with different personalities to 91 participants who collectively completed 218 design artifacts. The results from the studies indicate that the participantsâ€™ views and prioritization of the needs and system requirements were influenced by the personality traits of the provided personas.

Abstract = {90% of agile practitioners employ user stories for capturing requirements. Of these, 70% follow a simple template when creating user stories: As a <role> I want to <action>, [so that <benefit>]. User stories' popularity among practitioners and their simple yet strict structure make them ideal candidates for automatic reasoning based on natural language processing. In our research, we have found that circa 50% of real-world user stories contain easily preventable errors that may endanger their potential. To alleviate this problem, we have created methods, theories and tools that support creating better user stories. This tutorial combines our previous work into a pipeline for working with user stories: (1) The basics of creating user stories, and their use in requirements engineering; (2) How to improve user story quality with the Quality User Story Framework and AQUSA tool; and (3) How to generate conceptual models from user stories using the Visual Narrator and the Interactive Narrat},

Therefore, many researchers have proposed various requirement elicitation techniques and studied the pros and cons of these techniques.

@article{c_web_survey_article_how_to_increase_efficiency,
Abstract = {With the growing possibilities for conducting web surveys, researchers increasingly use such surveys to recruit student samples for research purposes in a wide array of social science disciplines. Simultaneously, higher education students are recurrently asked to complete course and teacher evaluations online and to participate in small-scale research projects of fellow students, potentially leading to survey fatigue among student populations across the globe. One of the most frequently reported effects of over-surveying is a decrease in overall response rates. This situation has significant impacts on the generalizability and external validity of findings based on web surveys. The collection of reliable data is, nevertheless, crucial for researchers as well as educational practitioners and administrators, and strategies should be developed for achieving acceptable response rates.

The wives of these video game developers and members of the game community decry these working conditions and challenge dominant ideologies about making games. This article contributes to the work intensification literature by challenging the belief that long hours are necessary and inevitable to make successful games, discussing the negative toll of extreme work on workers and their families, and by highlighting that the project-based structure of game development both creates extreme work conditions and inhibits resistance. It considers how extreme work practices are legitimized through neo-normative control mechanisms made possible through project-based work structures and the perceived imperative of a race or 'crunch' to meet project deadlines.

In examining these workers, this article responds to calls for renewed attention to the role of the occupation in understanding project-based workers in boundaryless careers. Specifically, this article uses secondary analysis of online sources to demonstrate that video game developers can be understood as a unique social group called an occupational community (OC). Once this classification has been made, the concept of OC can be used in future research to understand video game workers in terms of identity formation, competency development, career advancement and support, collective action, as well as adherence to and deviance from organizational and industry norms.

While it is true that a systematic use of Design Thinking (DT) throughout the curriculum would certainly improve the situation, a different approach is clearly needed, most likely an approach that combines DT with gamification, and that makes optimal use of project-based learning (PBL) using agile methods. In order to refine and clarify our possible contribution on the conjunction of such perspectives, we conducted an initial literature review that validated our objectives. Complementarily, we also defined a roadmap to transform such intentions into practical actions towards the creation of a new game development model based on DT principles.

Abstract = {Though dissatisfied with some management practices and working conditions, like most high-tech knowledge workers, videogame developers remain reluctant towards unionization. This article examines the factors of collective action among developers as an example, using data gathered from an international survey and interviews. We conclude that developers meet some conditions conducive to collective action but face many obstacles as well, both to collective action and to unionization proper. This does not lead us to share the belief of a decline in collective action, but rather raises the issue of conflating union action and collective action. Our study reveals how unsuited the general North American trade union system is to their situation, as it is to project-based environments and knowledge workers in general.
